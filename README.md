# Machine Learning Multilayer Perceptron

In this project I create a popular type of artificial neural network: a multilayer perceptron (MLP).  This perceptron uses a sigmoid activation function, and learns through backpropagation.  For more details and some classification examples this MLP performs, please see the .pdf file associated with this project.
